#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(log n) => Logarithmic Time

The runtime complexity is dependent on n, the time complexity is O(log n) and the value
of a is doubled for each iteration for the given value of n and there wil be only 8 iteration

b)
O(n log n) => Long Linear Time

c)
O(n) => Linear Time

The number of additional operations the algorithm needs to perform
grows in direct proportion to the increase in input size n

## Exercise II
